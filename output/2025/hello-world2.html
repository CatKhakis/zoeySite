<h3>What could be a more fitting hello world than a dev log documenting making this very site?</h3>
<p>orignally i had intended on using Ghost for blogging purposes but it was far too 'polished' for me. i wanted something that i could really make my own rather than something that looks nice by default. i have been very inspired by <a href="https://eev.ee">eevee's site</a> that she recently redesigned at the time of writing this. her blog post <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2024/12/03/fresh-start/">Fresh start</a> details her feelings about the blog itself and the direction she wants to take it. she gave her reasoning for opting to use pelican as the backbone for the site and since i trust her knowledge and enjoy the design of it i thought i might as well follow her paw prints and go the same route.</p>
<p>i'd like to outline my goals and methodology in this first post and will update links to future posts about developing specific features.
Dillan Stock of The Stock Pot on Youtube posted <a href="https://youtu.be/3zfIUSg9lm4?si=EwVH8olMrU9eg_5c">this fantastic video</a> discussing his goals for his smart home and i find his thought process absolutely genius. i highly reccomend his channel- nothing but the best content, especially if you're interesting in smart home automation in the slightest. he breaks it down into what he actually <em>wants</em> rather than being influenced by what flashy smart home gadgets exist out there. finding specific devices is about what fits your desires, not picking up the cool devices and trying to force your desires to fit that product. this is why Ghost wasnt the right pick for this site. yes- its a good product as far as i can tell but its not primarily addressing what i want out of a blog. its the flashy smart home device that i could learn, but i'd be tackling it the wrong way. </p>
<h3>i want this site to</h3>
<ul>
<li>be a place where i can <em>really</em> get into the weeds on projects im doing. </li>
<li>function as a digital busniess card like caard or other sites do.</li>
<li>allow me a place to write long form <em>nuanced</em> opinion pieces that wouldnt work well on the bird app.</li>
<li>be a portfolio for all of my different projects: fursuit making, web development, microcontroller tinkering, and whatever else i end up getting my paws on.</li>
<li>be a home for my silly little projects that dont fit elsewhere in the world i.e. i'd love to make a nice sudoku app.</li>
<li>share accounts of my convention experiences.</li>
<li>let me have fun !!!</li>
</ul>
<p>i'm so excited to get to make my own place on the internet. i've been wanting to make a blog for the longest time, but im a very busy puppy and starting is always the hardest part. i'll probably write a more indepth analysis but i really believe that more critters should focus on blogs rather than social media. social media is great in a lot of ways but i think its eroded a lot of <em>intentionality</em>. i'll expand on this when i write about ipods, physical photos, and my friend's amazing idea for bringing physical media back in the modern era.</p>
<h1>pelican</h1>
<p>wow. this is a lot. 
the version of me at the end of this post will be a lot smarter than i am now.</p>
<p>the first time i dipped my paws into web dev was a few months ago and it has gotten me hooked. i started out using Processing javascript, hacking with some quickstart templates, and then going full into making ExpressJS backends and frontends. with how much i've fallen in love with js it's going to be weird departing it to build this site. 
i'd like to have fun little interactable javascript elements, but the core of the website should be as lightweight as possible. modern web design really struggles with optimization and that is another facet of a lack of <em>intentionality</em>.</p>
<p>making it is more important than making it perfect.</p>
<h1>goals</h1>
<p>[ ] - business card top left with socials
[ ] - zoey ref sheet page
[ ] - fursuit work
[ ] - list of projects with articles and pages inside</p>
<h2>business card 'header'</h2>
<p>something interesting about the modern internet is how browsers are SOOO advanced. the amount of things you can do purely via html and css is mind boggling. so then... why does the internet feel so dead now? its too sleek and too 'perfect'. its obviously not about the technology!</p>
