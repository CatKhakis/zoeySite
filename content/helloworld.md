Title: Hello World!

### What could be a more fitting hello world than a dev log documenting making this very site?

orignally i had intended on using Ghost for blogging purposes but it was far too 'polished' for me. i wanted something that i could really make my own rather than something that looks nice by default. i have been very inspired by [eevee's site](https://eev.ee) that she recently redesigned at the time of writing this. her blog post [Fresh start](https://eev.ee/blog/2024/12/03/fresh-start/) details her feelings about the blog itself and the direction she wants to take it. she gave her reasoning for opting to use pelican as the backbone for the site and since i trust her knowledge and enjoy the design of it i thought i might as well follow her paw prints and go the same route.

i'd like to outline my goals and methodology in this first post and will update links to future posts about developing specific features.
Dillan Stock of The Stock Pot on Youtube posted [this fantastic video](https://youtu.be/3zfIUSg9lm4?si=EwVH8olMrU9eg_5c) discussing his goals for his smart home and i find his thought process absolutely genius. i highly reccomend his channel- nothing but the best content, especially if you're interesting in smart home automation in the slightest. he breaks it down into what he actually *wants* rather than being influenced by what flashy smart home gadgets exist out there. finding specific devices is about what fits your desires, not picking up the cool devices and trying to force your desires to fit that product. this is why Ghost wasnt the right pick for this site. yes- its a good product as far as i can tell but its not primarily addressing what i want out of a blog. its the flashy smart home device that i could learn, but i'd be tackling it the wrong way. 

### i want this site to

- be a place where i can *really* get into the weeds on projects im doing. 
- function as a digital busniess card like caard or other sites do.
- allow me a place to write long form *nuanced* opinion pieces that wouldnt work well on the bird app.
- be a portfolio for all of my different projects: fursuit making, web development, microcontroller tinkering, and whatever else i end up getting my paws on.
- be a home for my silly little projects that dont fit elsewhere in the world i.e. i'd love to make a nice sudoku app.
- share accounts of my convention experiences.
- let me have fun !!!
